The Chain of Custody form is a critical element of a forensic investigation because examiners use it to record the history of the evidence from the time it is found until the case is closed or goes to court. By keeping this record, examiners can show that the integrity of the evidence has been preserved and is not open to compromise. In the unfortunate event that evidence does become contaminated, the chain of custody will clearly identify the responsible individual.
A Chain of Custody form keeps track of three pieces of important information (in addition to all the details that uniquely identify the specific piece of evidence):
Where the evidence was stored?
Who had access to the evidence and when?
What actions were taken to the evidence?
As an example, please refer to this generic chain of custody from NIST:

For this project, your group will write a program that will be a digital equivalent of a chain of custody form. Each entry in the form will be stored in a blockchain of your own creation.
Blockchain technology has been touted as a solution that will improve every aspect of digital communication. However, real-world results have been practically non-existent. Consider this flow chart that explores some use cases where a blockchain may be a promising idea:

Common Requirements
Your blockchain chain of custody program must implement the following commands:
bchoc add -c case_id -i item_id [-i item_id ...] -c creator -p password(creator’s)
bchoc checkout -i item_id -p password
bchoc checkin -i item_id -p password
bchoc show cases -p password
bchoc show items -c case_id -p password
bchoc show history [-c case_id] [-i item_id] [-n num_entries] [-r] -p password
bchoc remove -i item_id -y reason -p password(creator’s)
bchoc init
bchoc verify

[ ] >> optional arguments
Where the parameters must conform to the following specifications:
add
Add a new evidence item to the blockchain and associate it with the given case identifier. For users’ convenience, more than one item_id may be given at a time, which will create a blockchain entry for each item without the need to enter the case_id multiple times. The state of a newly added item is CHECKEDIN. The given evidence ID must be unique (i.e., not already used in the blockchain) to be accepted. The password must be that of the creator. 
checkout
Add a new checkout entry to the chain of custody for the given evidence item. Checkout actions may only be performed on evidence items that have already been added to the blockchain. The password must be that of anyone from the owners. 
checkin
Add a new checkin entry to the chain of custody for the given evidence item. Checkin actions may only be performed on evidence items that have already been added to the blockchain. The password must be that of anyone from the owners.
show cases
Display a list of all the cases that have been added to the blockchain.
show items
Display all the items corresponding to the case number in the request.
show history
Display the blockchain entries for the requested item giving the oldest first.
-r, –reverse
Reverses the order of the block entries to show the most recent entries first.
remove
Prevents any further action from being taken on the evidence item specified. The specified item must have a state of CHECKEDIN for the action to succeed. The password must be that of the creator. 
init
Sanity check. Only starts up and checks for the initial block.
verify
Parse the blockchain and validate all entries.
-c case_id
Specifies the case identifier that the evidence is associated with. Must be a valid UUID. When used with log only blocks with the given case_id are returned.
-i item_id
Specifies the evidence item’s identifier. When used with log  only blocks with the given item_id are returned. The item ID must be unique within the blockchain. This means you cannot re-add an evidence item once the remove action has been performed on it.
-p password
Has to be one of the creators or owners. The passwords will be provided to you. 
-n num_entries
When used with history, shows num_entries number of block entries.
-y reason, --why reason
 Reason for the removal of the evidence item. Must be one of: DISPOSED, DESTROYED, or RELEASED. If the reason given is RELEASED, -o must also be given.
-o owner
Information about the lawful owner to whom the evidence was released. At this time, text is free-form and does not have any requirements.
Data structure
Every block in the blockchain will have the same structure: 
Offset, Length (bytes), Field Name  - Description
0x00 (0), 32* (256 bits), Previous Hash - SHA256 hash of this block's parent
0x20 (32), 8 (64 bits), Timestamp - Regular Unix timestamp. Must be printed in ISO 8601 format, anytime displayed to the user. Stored as an 8-byte float (double)
0x28 (40), 32 (256 bits), Case ID - UUID (Encrypted using AES ECB, stored as hex)
0x48 (72), 32 (256 bits), Evidence Item ID - 4 bytes integer (Encrypted using AES ECB, stored as hex)
0x68 (104), 12** (96 bits), State - Must be one of: INITIAL (for the initial block ONLY), CHECKEDIN, CHECKEDOUT, DISPOSED, DESTROYED, or RELEASED
0x74 (116), 12 (96 bits), Creator - Free form text with max 12 characters
0x80 (128), 12 (96 bits), Owner - Free form text with max 16 characters (Must be one of Police, Lawyer, Analyst, Executive)
0x8c (140), 4 (32 bits), Data Length (byte count) - 4 byte integer
0x90 (144), 0 to 2^32, Data - Free form text with byte length specified in Data LengNote
*The length of the Previous Hash field is only 32 bytes, it has 4 bytes alignment.
**The State field is padded with an extra byte (for a total of 12 bytes or 96 bits), making the Data Length field’s offset 0x70, or byte 112 in decimal.
If you use Python to do the project, I recommend you use the struct format string "32s d 32s 32s 12s 12s 12s I" to pack and unpack the first 6 fields of the block, which will handle the byte alignment issue for you.
Finally, you don't have to add extra paddings at the end of the block to have the exact block size, unless it is the string fields.
The Cae ID has to be a UUID and the Item ID has to be a 4-byte integer. Both these values have to be encrypted using AES ECB mode of encryption before storing in the data file. (The key will be given to you) 
The actual values should only be shown if a valid password is provided with the show command. Otherwise, the encrypted values should be shown.

The location of the blockchain file doesn’t matter while you are implementing and locally testing your program. However, when we grade your assignment, we will set the environment variable BCHOC_FILE_PATH to the path to the file your program should use.
Important
Make sure that your program checks the BCHOC_FILE_PATH environment variable first before using any other path! Otherwise, your program will fail the grading test cases.
When the program starts it should check if there are any existing blocks and create a block with the following information if it doesn’t find any:
Previous Hash: None, null, etc.
Timestamp: Current time
Case ID: None, null, etc.
Evidence Item ID: None, null, etc.
State: “INITIAL”
Creatore: None, null, etc.
Owner: None, null, etc.
Data Length: 14 bytes
Data: The string: “Initial block”
All block data must be stored in a binary format. Plain text, JSON, CSV, and other similar formats are invalid for this assignment.
All timestamps must be stored in UTC and account for the difference between local time and UTC.
Note
For a Python library that helps deal with timestamps, check out Maya.
Important
There are MANY conditions that could put your program into an error state. Whenever this occurs, your program should exit with a non-zero exit status.
Using this convention will have a few benefits. First, it will force you to do the work of thinking through the various execution paths that could lead to an error state, which is an excellent exercise that will develop your software engineering skills. Second, it gives you the freedom of coming up with your own meaningful messages to the user, rather than me coming up with them for you. Third, it makes it simpler for us to grade your program because all we have to check in these cases is the exit code of your program to verify it is functioning correctly, while also decreasing potential string-matching errors.
As the link above on exit status discusses, “The specific set of codes returned is unique to the program that sets it.” This means you get to define your own exit codes and what they mean. As long as you use the convention of zero indicating success and non-zero indicating failure (error), you can choose to use whatever code values you like.


Example
Below are some examples of input/output for your program. Lines beginning with $ are the input and everything else is the output from the given command.
More to be added

Initializing the blockchain:
$ bchoc init
Blockchain file not found. Created INITIAL block.

Checking the initialization:
$ bchoc init
Blockchain file found with INITIAL block.

Warning
Normally, you should be incredibly careful about accepting user input that you later use and print to the screen. But for the purposes of this project, you don’t need to worry about sanitizing input.
Verifying the blockchain:
$ bchoc verify
Transactions in blockchain: 6
State of blockchain: CLEAN

Verifying the blockchain when it has errors:
$ bchoc verify
Transactions in blockchain: 6
State of blockchain: ERROR
Bad block: ca53b1f604b633a6bc3cf75325932596efc4717fca53b1f604b633a6bc3cf732
Parent block: NOT FOUND

Or:
$ bchoc verify
Transactions in blockchain: 6
State of blockchain: ERROR

Or:
$ bchoc verify

State of blockchain: ERROR
Bad block: 99bcaaf29b1ff8dac2c529a8503d92e43921c335c853b1f604b6c33a6c3c475d
Block contents do not match block checksum.

Or:
$ bchoc verify
Transactions in blockchain: 6
State of blockchain: ERROR
Bad block: e3f2b0427b57241225ba1ffc2b67fecd64d07613fa3b1f604b633a6bac1cf75c
Item checked out or checked in after removal from chain.

Note
For testing purposes, you can assume that a blockchain will only have one error in it. If this weren’t the case, it would matter which direction you traverse the chain while validating, and I don’t want you to have to worry about that.
In cases of errors (invalid operations), exit with error code 1.
